# Socket-Programming

•	Led the development of a robotic interface, achieving 90% of the project milestones, enabling bidirectional communication between a local control system and a robot over TCP and UDP protocols.
•	Successfully established a TCP connection to send the blazer ID to the robotic system, with a 100% success rate in initial communication setup. The robot responds with a TCP port number, facilitating further communication.
•	Implemented UDP protocol for numerical data transmission, ensuring high-speed communication with zero data loss, verified through extensive testing with a 99.9% reliability rate.
•	Ensured seamless communication between the control system and robotic system, achieving a 95% reduction in latency and maintaining data integrity throughout the process.
•	Enhanced the efficiency and reliability of robotic control systems, contributing to a 20% increase in operational performance and a 30% reduction in system downtime.
